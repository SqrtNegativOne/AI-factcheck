Claim extraction—especially from unstructured or argumentative texts like essays, social media, or legal documents—benefits from chunking strategies that isolate semantically meaningful units while preserving the argumentative structure. Below are multiple chunking strategies, each suitable for different models (rule-based, ML-based, transformer-based):

---

### 1. **Clause-Level Chunking**

* **Definition**: Split sentences into individual clauses (independent and dependent).
* **Method**: Use syntactic parsers (e.g., spaCy, CoreNLP) to identify `SBAR`, `VP`, `NP` structures.
* **Advantages**: Fine-grained; often aligns with premises and claims.
* **Disadvantages**: Can over-fragment the text, reducing coherence.

**Example**:

> "Although the experiment failed, it revealed critical flaws."
> → \[Although the experiment failed], \[it revealed critical flaws]

---

### 2. **Discourse-Based Chunking**

* **Definition**: Segment text based on discourse markers and rhetorical structure (RST, PDTB).
* **Method**: Identify connectives ("because", "therefore", "however") to chunk along discourse boundaries.
* **Advantages**: Captures argumentative flow and supports reasoning chains.
* **Disadvantages**: Depends on quality of discourse parsing, which is often unreliable on noisy text.

---

### 3. **Semantic Role Chunking (SRL-Based)**

* **Definition**: Use Semantic Role Labeling to chunk based on predicate-argument structure.
* **Method**: Identify predicates and associated arguments as units.
* **Advantages**: Focuses on action and participants, often revealing implicit claims.
* **Disadvantages**: Misses higher-level claim structures (e.g., value judgments).

---

### 4. **Sentence-Level Chunking**

* **Definition**: Treat each sentence as a single chunk.
* **Method**: Standard sentence tokenization.
* **Advantages**: Simple baseline; works surprisingly well in cleaner data (e.g., academic writing).
* **Disadvantages**: Overly coarse for complex or multi-claim sentences.

---

### 5. **Sliding Window with Overlap**

* **Definition**: Use fixed-size token or sentence windows with overlap (e.g., 50 tokens, 25 overlap).
* **Method**: Useful for transformer models (context preservation).
* **Advantages**: Ensures local coherence; avoids context loss.
* **Disadvantages**: Produces redundancy and increases inference time.

---

### 6. **Constituency-Based Chunking**

* **Definition**: Use the syntactic tree to extract full phrases (NPs, VPs, S, SBAR).
* **Method**: Parse trees from Stanford Parser or similar.
* **Advantages**: Language-theoretic; allows focusing on structured arguments.
* **Disadvantages**: Overhead from parsing; may split semantically coherent claims.

---

### 7. **Topic or Theme-Based Chunking**

* **Definition**: Divide text based on topic shifts or thematic units.
* **Method**: Use LDA, TextTiling, or BERT embedding clustering.
* **Advantages**: Good for long documents with multiple claims.
* **Disadvantages**: Requires high-level modeling and can be brittle in short texts.

---

### 8. **Entity-Based Chunking**

* **Definition**: Chunk around core entities or concepts (argument roles).
* **Method**: Coreference resolution + entity grid analysis.
* **Advantages**: Useful for tracking claims across sentences.
* **Disadvantages**: Poor performance if entity resolution fails.

---

### 9. **Prosodic or Punctuation-Based Chunking**

* **Definition**: Split at punctuation (commas, semicolons, colons) to capture spoken-like chunking.
* **Method**: Use token-based heuristics.
* **Advantages**: Lightweight; aligns well with rhetorical pauses.
* **Disadvantages**: No semantic understanding; brittle with complex syntax.

---

### 10. **Transformer-Aware Chunking**

* **Definition**: Dynamically chunk based on transformer attention patterns or model token limits.
* **Method**: Use model attention maps or BERTScore coherence to define chunk boundaries.
* **Advantages**: Model-driven; adapts to architecture.
* **Disadvantages**: Opaque and computationally expensive.

---

### 11. **Hybrid Heuristic Chunking**

* **Definition**: Combine multiple above strategies (e.g., sentence + clause + discourse markers).
* **Method**: Rule-based pipeline or ensemble of segmenters.
* **Advantages**: Balanced granularity.
* **Disadvantages**: Hard to tune; edge-case sensitive.
