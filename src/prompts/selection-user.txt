Sentence:
<insert>

4-step stream of consciousness thought process:
1. Reflect on criteria at a high level: <insert>
2. Provide an objective description of the excerpt, the sentence, and its surrounding sentences: <insert>
3. Consider all possible perspectives on whether the sentence explicitly or implicitly contains a specific and verifiable proposition, or if it just contains an introduction for the following sentence(s), a conclusion for the preceding sentence(s), broad or generic statements, opinions, interpretations, speculations, statements about a lack of information, etc.: <insert>
4. Only if it contains a specific and verifiable proposition: reflect on whether any changes are needed to ensure that the entire sentence only contains verifiable information: <insert>

Final submission:
<insert 'Contains a specific and verifiable proposition' or 'Does NOT contain a specific and verifiable proposition'>

Sentence with only verifiable information:
<insert changed sentence, or 'remains unchanged' if no changes, or 'None' if the sentence does NOT contain a specific and verifiable proposition>
